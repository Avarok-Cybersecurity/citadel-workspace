//! Member Integration Tests
//!
//! This file serves as documentation for the member-related integration tests.
//!
//! The member integration tests have been organized into separate test files:
//! - member_operations_test.rs - Member CRUD operations
//! - permission_operations_test.rs - Permission management
//! - role_operations_test.rs - Custom role operations  
//! - admin_operations_test.rs - Admin multi-user and access control
//!
//! Each test file runs independently and contains focused test cases.
