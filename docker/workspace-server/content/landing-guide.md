# Welcome to Citadel Workspaces

Welcome to your collaborative workspace powered by the Citadel Protocol. This guide will help you get started with the platform.

## Workspace Hierarchy

Your workspace is organized into three levels:

### 1. Workspace (Top Level)
The workspace is your organization's home. It contains all offices and their rooms.

### 2. Offices
Offices are major areas within your workspace, like departments or project teams:
- **General** - Community-wide discussions
- **Engineering** - Technical collaboration
- **Landing Page** - This getting started guide

### 3. Rooms
Each office can have multiple rooms for focused discussions:
- **Frontend** and **Backend** rooms under Engineering
- **Random** and **Introductions** under General

## Getting Started

1. **Browse Offices** - Use the sidebar to navigate between offices
2. **Join Conversations** - Click on any room to view its content and chat
3. **Chat Features** - Rooms with chat enabled have a Chat tab alongside Content

## Features

### Content Tabs
Each office and room can have:
- **Content Tab** - Markdown documentation and guides
- **Chat Tab** - Real-time group messaging (when enabled)

### Mentioning Users
Use `@username` to mention someone in chat. They'll receive a notification.

### Threading
Reply to messages to create threads for organized discussions.

## Need Help?

Visit the **Announcements** room for important updates, or drop by **General > Random** for casual conversations.
