# Workspace Basics

Understanding how workspaces, offices, and rooms work together.

## Hierarchy

```
Workspace
  |-- Office A
  |     |-- Room 1
  |     |-- Room 2
  |-- Office B
        |-- Room 3
```

## Offices

Offices are the main organizational units. Each office has:
- A **Content tab** with documentation or resources
- A **Chat tab** for discussions (if enabled)
- Multiple **rooms** for specific topics

## Rooms

Rooms are nested within offices for more focused discussions:
- Each room has its own chat history
- Rooms inherit permissions from their parent office
- Content can be customized per room

## Permissions

- **Owner**: Full control over the workspace
- **Admin**: Can manage offices, rooms, and members
- **Member**: Can view and chat in permitted areas
- **Guest**: Limited access as configured
