## Rounds 608-620 — the reconnection wedge, root-caused

Four observations across three different reconnection tests, all
`Test timed out: Elapsed(())` on the outer 240s budget against tests that take
~1.6s. The fourth (PR #288's coverage job, whose entire diff is inside
`#[cfg(test)]` in another crate) finally carried enough log to place it.

**Cause.** `trigger_rekey(wait_for_completion=true)` parks on a oneshot and, on
each 10s wait timeout, re-checks whether the version advanced; if not it loops
again — "the rekey might still complete". Nothing bounds that loop.
`spawn_rekey_process` has two exits, the shutdown signal and its inner task
ending; both log and fall off the end without taking the pending
`local_listener`. The oneshot sender lives in the manager struct, not the task,
so it is not dropped either. The caller waits for a notification nobody can send
and a version nobody will advance. The reconnection tests hit it because they
are the ones that tear a session down mid-rekey. Fixed in Citadel-Protocol #289.

**A prediction I got wrong.** The record previously predicted that merging #285
(a 60s bound on that loop) would clear this flake. It would not: a bound turns an
infinite hang into a 60s error, and the test still fails. #285 remains the right
backstop for any other way the notification could go missing; #289 removes the
cause.

**Three controls to get one that measured anything.** The first two versions of
the new test passed with the fix removed. Shutting a real peer down and
triggering immediately let the peer answer normally — `shutdown()` only signals,
and the task serves rekeys until it has seen ~2s of quiet. Waiting that quiet out
instead killed the peer's receiver, so the caller's *send* failed and it errored
before reaching the wait loop at all. Parking a caller needs a send that succeeds
into silence. Both false greens are written into the test.

**A false conclusion, caught before it was recorded.** Reading a truncated log
window I concluded the wedge was a synchronous lock acquisition with no `.await`
between two checkpoints — which would have meant no async timeout could ever fix
it. The missing checkpoint was simply outside the `tail -30`; it was there at
1ms. Widen the window before concluding from an absent log line.

**Also this wave.** `AddrInUse` killing `group_chat::test_internal_service_group_create`
at 0.012s: `get_free_port` bound `:0`, read the port and dropped the listener, so
the kernel could hand that same ephemeral port to another test process — and
nextest gives every test its own process, so no in-process registry can see it.
Ports now come from 20000..32000, below the ephemeral range on Linux and macOS,
partitioned by pid into disjoint 16-port blocks. Control: the old body returns
port 52060 and fails the range assertion. Two of that fix's three tests stay green
under the defect — they guard other properties and are not evidence about it.

Deleted `yjs-merkle-strategy/sync.ts`'s `determineSyncAction` and
`computeStateVectorHash`: a complete, plausible chunk-level sync strategy with
zero callers anywhere, tests included. The cost was never the dead bytes, it was
the false map.

## Rounds 621-634 — the permission model, audited operation by operation

Started as bookkeeping: 11 of 21 `Permission` variants are never referenced in
the server. Counting variants is the wrong question, though — what matters is
whether the OPERATION each one names is gated, under whatever name. Checked one
at a time:

- `DeleteWorkspace`, `UpdateWorkspace` — zero refs repo-wide, but both
  operations gate on admin-or-owner plus the master password. Redundant
  vocabulary.
- `UpdateNode`, `EditNodeConfig`, `UpdateNodeSettings` — covered by
  `EditTreeStructure` / `EditMdx`, chosen per-field by what the update changes.
- `ReadMessages` — group reads gate on `ViewContent`, writes on `SendMessages`.
- `BanUser`, `ManageDomains`, `ConfigureSystem`, `EditWorkspaceConfig`,
  `ManageNodeTypes` — no such operation exists in the server. The matrix offers
  toggles for capabilities that are not implemented. LOW, and misleading.
- Editing permissions (`UpdateMemberPermissions`) is admin-gated. Sound.
- **`UploadFiles` / `DownloadFiles` — gated by nothing.** See below.

**The one real hole.** `NodeResult::ObjectTransferHandle` auto-accepted every
transfer behind one global boolean, and neither file permission was consulted
anywhere in the server, while the matrix showed operators a "Files" category
with per-user toggles and allowed/total badges. `Permission::for_role` grants
Guest `ViewContent` and nothing else — its own comment says this makes the role
"strictly weaker than Member" — so a read-only Guest could push files into
server storage and pull them back out. Group messaging already carried exactly
this fix, in a comment describing a Guest posting into every room it could see.
The file path never received it. Twenty-third guarded/unguarded twin.

Attribution needed new kernel state, because transfer events arrive on a
different branch of the event loop than the per-connection actor and carry only
a session CID. Cleared by a `Drop` guard, not a line at the end of the loop:
that task has several exits and CIDs are reused, so a stale attribution would
let the next connection inherit the previous account's authorisation.

**A regression I checked for and did not find.** `User::new` builds an EMPTY
permission map, so a Member created at connect holds nothing at
`WORKSPACE_ROOT_ID`. Had `check_entity_permission` been a strict per-domain
lookup, the new gate would have refused every ordinary user and broken all file
transfer. It is not: the final fallback is
`Permission::for_role(&user.role) && is_member_of_domain(..)`, so Members keep
transferring and Guests do not. Worth writing down that this was verified
against the running code rather than assumed from the test, which had set the
permissions explicitly and so could not have caught it.

**Still open (LOW).** `get_workspace` is membership-gated, not
permission-gated, and banning only changes a role — so a banned account still
reads workspace name, description, metadata and office list. Recorded rather
than fixed: "ban" is not a wired feature (no operation, no gate), and building
one is outside this goal.

Also this wave: `update_workspace` gated on the master password alone and then
set `role = Admin` unconditionally. Correct exactly once — the seeded root
workspace is claimed that way — but the door never closed, and the password is
ROOT's, stored on every workspace by `create_workspace`. Any authenticated
holder could join a workspace they were not in and promote themselves to Admin
on it. `delete_workspace` had already been given the admin-or-owner check, in
the same file, with a comment explaining why.

## Open finding — a lagged broadcast subscriber loses updates silently

`async_kernel.rs:1688`. The per-connection broadcast receiver has capacity 100.
On `RecvError::Lagged(n)` it logs a warning and continues, so those n workspace
updates — node created/deleted/moved, member role changed — are gone, and the
client is never told it is stale. There is no resync response variant to send
instead, and the UI's full refetch (`post-auth-setup.ts`) runs on
authentication, not on demand.

Recorded rather than fixed, deliberately. Reachability is not demonstrated: a
connection must fall 100 STRUCTURAL broadcasts behind, and those are human-paced
in normal operation, so a client that far behind is probably disconnecting
anyway. The candidate fixes are a new protocol variant (regenerates the TS
bindings) or closing the connection so the client reconnects and refetches — the
second risks reconnect churn in exactly the overload conditions that produced
the lag. Neither is worth shipping on a hypothesis while the merge PRs are in
CI.

To promote this to a real finding, reproduce it: hold a client's socket while
driving >100 structural changes, then assert the client's tree diverges from the
server's.

## Rounds 635-648 — a proven HIGH behind a wrong hypothesis

`test_internal_service_peer_with_psk_negative_case` was ignored with the note
"Peer A is never sent a connect notification when the PSK will not verify — is
that intended?". The tempting move was to answer it from the source: a responder
should NOT be told about a connect whose PSK fails, because that is an oracle,
so the test's shape is wrong. Running it says the opposite. **A is notified.**
Round one works exactly as designed and both sides get their
`PeerConnectFailure`. Round two dies on the initiator's own side before A is
involved:

    [PeerConnect] connect_to_peer_custom FAILED:
        RekeyUpdate (12) "Rekey update error: Encryption failure"

So the finding is not about notifications at all: **a failed PSK connect poisons
the pair, and every later connect between those two peers fails — including one
carrying the correct password.** Mistype a peer session password once and you
cannot connect to that peer again. HIGH.

Reproduced minimally in `tests/psk_retry_after_failure.rs`: two rounds on a
freshly registered pair, round one mismatched, round two with both sides
presenting the same correct password. Every wait names its round, because
"round one passes and round two does not" IS the finding and a bare timeout
hides it.

Ruled out, each by experiment rather than reading:
  - the responder — round one notifies A correctly;
  - PSK connects in general — `test_internal_service_peer_with_psk` connects a
    fresh pair with the right password in ~2s;
  - a lingering virtual connection — adding `disconnect()` to `connect.rs`'s
    failure arm changed nothing (the repro killed my own first fix in minutes,
    which is what having a repro before a fix buys);
  - a stale password — `store_session_password` inserts, so round two does
    overwrite round one's value.

Residue narrowed to per-peer handshake state that failure never clears:
`peer_kem_states` is inserted per attempt and only ever `clear()`ed wholesale in
`session_manager`, with no per-peer removal on failure; the vconn is removed only
on an explicit `PeerSignal::Disconnect`; and `remove_session_password` exists for
this exact job as `#[allow(dead_code)]` with a TODO — written, never wired.

Left proven and ignored rather than guessed at. One confident fix in this area
was already refuted within the hour, and the next candidates are inside the KEM
handshake, where a plausible-but-wrong change would tear down working
connections. `-- --ignored` reproduces it in ~40s.

**Prediction resolved.** The record predicted #285 alone would clear the
reconnection wedge; that was wrong, and #289 (waking rekey waiters when the
process ends) is the actual cause-level fix. Evidence: `coverage` — the exact
job that failed on #288 with `reconnection_p2p_one_c2s ... Test timed out` —
passes on #289, as do `citadel_sdk (macos-latest)` and the Ratchet Stability
Test. Intermittent failures make that a strong signal, not proof.

## CORRECTION — #289 did not fix the reconnection wedge

This supersedes two earlier claims in this file: that the wedge was "Fixed in
Citadel-Protocol #289", and the entry asserting #289 was "the actual cause-level
fix" on the evidence of a passing `coverage` job.

Both are wrong, and the disproof is direct. PR #288's `citadel_sdk
(macos-latest)` job wedged on a base that CONTAINS #289 —
`reconnection_one_c2s::test_p2p_then_one_c2s_disconnect`, same 240s signature,
a fourth distinct test. And the warning #289 emits when it wakes a parked caller
("rekey process ended with a caller still waiting") appears ZERO times in that
log. Nobody was on that listener. #289 closed a real gap — its unit test fails
without it — but that gap was not this one.

The mistake worth keeping is the reasoning, not the conclusion: I treated ONE
passing job as evidence a known-intermittent failure was fixed. For a flake that
had already been seen four times, a single green run was never going to
distinguish "fixed" from "did not fire this time". The record said so
confidently anyway.

**What is actually known now**, after #290 made the phase markers survive CI's
`RUST_LOG=citadel=info` filter — 134 of them were bare `log::info!` and had been
dropped, which is why six observations produced no localisation at all:

  - Both peers complete phase one in full: register, C2S connect, C2S rekey,
    P2P register, P2P connect, P2P rekey.
  - The disconnecting side then never logs the line immediately after
    `conn.disconnect().await?`, and the other blocks for ever on the barrier it
    never reaches.
  - The only await between those two markers is that call, and the only
    unbounded await inside it is `while let Some(event) = subscription.next()`
    in the C2S branch of `disconnect()`.

PR #291 bounds that wait at 30s. It is offered as a bound, NOT as a proven fix:
there is no red-to-green control, because the hang still cannot be reproduced on
demand. What is controlled is that the new branch is live — setting the bound to
1ns fails `reconnection_c2s` with `RemoteDisconnectEventMissing (290)`.

If the wedge survives #291, the next log names a phase rather than a silence,
which is the point of having done #290 first.

## Gate verification — the guards were themselves controlled

A gate that cannot fail reports safety it never checked, which is the defect
this record is mostly about. So the gates were spot-controlled by planting the
violation each one exists to catch, and checking the exit code WITHOUT a pipe
(`| head` reports head's status, and that made three controls in this session
look green while they were red).

  - `check-handlers-cannot-panic` — planted `Some(1u8).unwrap()` in
    `requests/peer/connect.rs`. Exit 1, naming `connect.rs:36`.
  - `check-sender-identity` — rewrote `senderCid: peerCid.toString()` to
    `senderCid: payload.sender_cid` in `message-handler-routing.ts`. Exit 1,
    naming the line and explaining that `sender_cid` is chosen by the sender.
  - `no-new-unreferenced-exports` — planted an exported function nobody calls.
    Fails, naming it by path. It also carries its own guards: "scans a real
    corpus" and "has no stale entries".
  - `check-stack-reachable` — exit 1 with the UI unreachable. Its docstring
    records an earlier version that could NOT fail, because it read `fetch`
    error text and undici puts ECONNREFUSED in `error.cause` while `message` is
    the constant "fetch failed".
  - The four gates added this session (permission enforcement, listener
    fan-outs, generated artefacts, submodules populated) each shipped with their
    own control, one of which found a hole in the gate itself: reverting the
    file-transfer enforcement left `Permission::UploadFiles` matching, because
    `may_transfer`'s DOC COMMENT names it. Comments are now stripped before
    matching.

  - `check-intent-results-checked` — discarded the result of a `persist-tree`
    intent. Exit 1, naming the line and stating that the intent can resolve
    `{ success: false }`. Its docstring lists three user-visible data-loss bugs
    of that exact shape, each with a green toast on the other side of it.
  - `check-storage-keys` — added a `localStorage.getItem` of a key nothing
    writes. Exit 1, naming key and line.

The storage-keys control took two attempts, and the first failure was mine. I
planted a key that was neither read NOR written and the gate passed — correctly,
because the defect it guards is a key that IS READ and never written, which is
what makes a read return its default forever while the feature looks wired. A
control has to reproduce the defect's shape, not merely touch the same file.

  - `check-controls-are-wired` (UI) — planted an `<input defaultValue>` with no
    handler. Exit 1, naming file and line: "accepts input and discards it".
  - `check-presence-is-not-invented` (UI) — narrowed `isMemberOnline`'s return
    from `boolean | null` to `boolean`. Exit 1: "offline is an assertion about
    somebody who may be sitting right there."

Two of these controls were mis-aimed before they landed, and both mis-aims
looked like passes. One planted `isOnline: true` into `date-utils.ts`, which
that gate does not scan — it checks three named files. The other never planted
at all: zsh expanded an unquoted `--include=*.ts`, the file variable came back
empty, and the gate then "passed" against an unmodified tree. Neither produced
an error; both produced exit 0, which is exactly what success looks like.

That is now the fifth and sixth time in this session that a control silently
measured nothing. The reliable defence is to confirm the mutation applied before
reading the result — the two that were caught were caught because the planting
step printed what it did and the printout was wrong or absent.

**Correction to a count stated here earlier.** "All 43 gate scripts" counted only
`scripts/`. There are 44 there and 40 more in `citadel-workspaces/scripts/` —
**84** in total. Every one of them can fail, though a literal grep for
`process.exit(1)` misses `check-toast-clears-header`, which ends
`process.exit(failed ? 1 : 0)`; that is presence rather than reachability, and
the seven above are the sample that was actually exercised.

**Refuted while checking that.** Three npm aliases in the UI package.json —
`check:event-pairs`, `check:types`, `check:spec-copy` — appear in no workflow,
which looked like three gates written and never run. All three underlying
scripts ARE invoked by filename; only the aliases are redundant.
`check-every-gate-is-invoked` covers both script directories and was right.

## Audit against the original plan

The plan this work started from named specific defects. Checked one by one
rather than assumed closed:

| Plan item | State |
|---|---|
| `file-transfer/io.ts` fabricates a `/transfers/{id}/{name}` path and reports success without uploading | fixed — no such path, no `setTimeout` stub |
| `tree-deep-hierarchy.test.ts:409` `maxDepthSchemaSet = true; // Skip this test` | fixed — gone |
| Two `describe.skip`ped vitest files "needs rewrite for refactored API" | fixed — no `describe.skip` anywhere in `src/` |
| Seven orphaned specs with no npm script: chat-settings, native-file-picker, five reconnection/* | **all seven now in validate.yml** |
| Two toast systems mounted simultaneously | fixed — only `<Sonner />`, with the reasoning in App.tsx |
| Raw CIDs rendered as user identity in P2PPeerList | the flagged line is a React key and a handler argument, not display text |
| `typescript-client`'s `"test": "echo … && exit 0"` making a CI job unconditionally green | fixed — real `node --test`, plus an `assert-tests-exist` guard |
| ~697 hardcoded sleeps in the integration suite | **517 remain.** Reduced, not eliminated. |

The sleeps are the one item not closed. They are a runtime and flakiness cost
rather than a correctness defect — a `sleep()` followed by a real assertion is
slow, not false-passing — and the distinct footgun the record warns about
(`isVisible()` never waiting) is a separate thing, now guarded where it gated a
whole test. Recorded as outstanding rather than quietly dropped.
